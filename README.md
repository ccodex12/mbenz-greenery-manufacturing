To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, 
the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s 
biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on MercedesBenz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many 
possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic 
approach.
The objective is to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench and work with a dataset 
representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it 
takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower 
carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz’s standards.
